# Enigma Machine
This python script simulates the 1938 German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe Enigma machine, the most widely used variant of Enigma during the Second World War.

Like most computer science students I am a big fan of Alan Turing both for his research and for his work cracking the Nazi Enigma code at Bletchley Park. 

Out of curiosity I started studying the inner workings of the Enigma machine and got to asking how fast would it take a modern day computer to crack the Enigma code? It would probably take a fraction of a second using Alan Turing's methods but would a blind brute-force attack work in a reasonable amout of time given enough computing power?

To answer this question I first had to program a working Enigma machine.
